# 🕵️‍♀️ Responsible AI Inspector's Report 

## About This Project
This repository contains the evaluation report for the **"AI in the Real World — Judge the Bot"** assignment. As a Responsible AI Inspector, my mission was to investigate two real-world AI use cases, identifying potential issues and proposing ethical and responsible solutions.

The analysis addresses:
* **Bias and Fairness Issues:** Identifying preconceptions in AI systems, such as in a hiring bot.
* **Privacy and Transparency Concerns:** An analysis of a surveillance system and the lack of clarity in its decisions.
* **Responsible Improvement Suggestions:** Concrete proposals to make AI systems more equitable, transparent, and safe.

## 📂 Files Included
* `JudgeTheBot_augusto-mate.pdf`: The final report with the detailed analysis of the two cases.
* `README.md`: This introductory report for the project.
* **Online Report:**
